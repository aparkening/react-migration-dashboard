After studying film and art in western Massachusetts, she moved back to her hometown where she met Will and Kathleen Pratt while baking at a coffee shop Kathleen was working at. The three friends eventually moved to New York where Kathleen opened the Blue Bottle affiliate in Brooklyn and where Will worked as a roaster. Meanwhile, Briana lucked out working under some of Brooklyn’s best cooks and bakers at Pies ‘n’ Thighs, as well as M.Wells Diner. Briana moved to Maine in 2013, a year after Will and Kathleen opened the first Tandem Coffee location.

Briana and the rest of the baking team have a commitment to building strong relationships with Maine farms, featuring as many locally grown grains, fruits, produce, and meat as possible.

After studying film and art in western Massachusetts, she moved back to her hometown where she met Will and Kathleen Pratt while baking at a coffee shop Kathleen was working at. The three friends eventually moved to New York where Kathleen opened the Blue Bottle affiliate in Brooklyn and where Will worked as a roaster. Meanwhile, Briana lucked out working under some of Brooklyn’s best cooks and bakers at Pies ‘n’ Thighs, as well as M.Wells Diner. Briana moved to Maine in 2013, a year after Will and Kathleen opened the first Tandem Coffee location. In 2014, Briana helped the couple open their second location, the now-acclaimed Tandem Coffee + Bakery. At the bakery, you’ll find the pastry counter full of familiar classics with a bold, whimsical edge. Briana and the rest of the baking team have a commitment to building strong relationships with Maine farms, featuring as many locally grown grains, fruits, produce, and meat as possible. In 2015, Tandem Bakery was among BonAppetit magazine’s “50 Best New Restaurants in America” with Briana touted by the editors as a “pastry genius.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.chefsfeed.com/experts/6941-briana-holt\">https://www.chefsfeed.com/experts/6941-briana-holt</a></p>",
